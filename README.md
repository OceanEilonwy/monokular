# Monokular

The companion app to [Monokulo](https://github.com/OceanEilonwy/monokulo) that
helps you take Monero payments at the till using your existing POS apps.

When the cashier takes a Monero sale in their point of sale (Square first),
Monokular shows the customer the payment code and confirms when the money
arrives: in the Dynamic Island on iPhone, in Slide Over on iPad, and in a
floating bubble or Live Update notification on Android.

Monokulo is self-hosted, so Monokular always connects from a store's own
Monokulo dashboard (Store settings › Connected apps), never to a central
server.

## Status

Design stage. Nothing is built yet.

- [Design document](docs/design.md): the sale flow with Square, connected
  apps, push (Web Push, UnifiedPush and a relay for APNs/FCM), the Live
  Activity, battery use, the Monokulo side and this repository's layout.
- [Design mockups](https://claude.ai/artifact/Kb9AtJFBF3ockyddomLc6t): iPhone,
  iPad and Android screens, onboarding, settings and the web connect pages.
