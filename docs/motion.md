# Motion: the Android till

How the till moves, and why. Written by the lead designer for the motion
round (branch `motion`, base `f274ad7`), after reading every screen in
`android/app/src/main/kotlin/app/monokular/` and running the build on a
Pixel 9 Pro and a Pixel Tablet emulator: onboarding, the shift, a live
sale, the enlarged code, the close sheet, the order page, paid, ended, the
bubble and panel over another app, the tablet's floating panel, a phone on
its side and split screen. `docs/reports/motion/before/` holds clips of the
flows as they are today; the showcase puts the "after" beside them.

The design itself does not change (`docs/decisions/android.md` 60 to 89,
the till tweaks canvas): the panel with its grabber, the full-screen sale
with the tinted X, the close sheet, the enlarged white code, the icon-only
chip with its phase ring, the theme's colour roles. Motion refines how
those states reach each other.

## 1. Principles

Each is tied to one of the owner's goals (no motion for its own sake;
blazing fast and memory efficient; the code always scans; the design stays).

1. **Motion explains where things come from and go to, and nothing else.**
   A panel grows out of the bubble because it *is* the bubble opened; the
   enlarged code grows out of the code because it is the same code, bigger.
   If a movement doesn't answer "where did that come from?" or "where did
   it go?", it isn't made. Decoration (staggered lists, count-ups, shimmer,
   bouncing buttons) is out.
2. **The cashier never waits for it.** Every transition is interruptible
   at any frame and never blocks input: a second tap reverses a panel
   mid-grow, a fling carries its velocity into the collapse, Back during
   the enlarge shrinks from wherever it got to. Nothing is sequenced with
   delays; a motion that would need "wait, then" is two motions, or one
   with the second part driven by the first's progress.
3. **The code is sacred.** The QR bitmap is laid out once per sale and
   never re-laid out, re-encoded or redrawn module by module during a
   transition. It only ever moves or scales as one layer, so any frame a
   camera catches is a valid code at a valid size. At rest it is never
   smaller than designed (264 dp on the sale, 264/280 dp on the panel).
4. **Cheap by construction.** Animated values are read in the draw or
   layout phase (`graphicsLayer {}`, `drawBehind {}`, `offset {}`,
   `Modifier.Node`), never in composition per frame; nothing is allocated
   per frame; there is exactly one frame clock (Compose's) and two loops
   in the whole app (the bubble's pulse and the loading mark's glints),
   both only while something is being waited for. No `Handler.postDelayed`
   choreography, no `ValueAnimator`, no reflection, no hand-rolled loops.
5. **One system.** Every spring and duration is a named preset in
   `ui/Motion.kt`, picked by purpose, so two things of the same kind move
   the same way and a timing is changed in one place. No numbers at call
   sites.
6. **Reduced motion is one switch.** The animator duration scale is read
   in one place; loops stop, spatial moves become short fades or snaps.
7. **Haptics confirm, never decorate.** One `CONFIRM` when a payment
   lands, on whichever surface the cashier is looking at. Nothing on taps,
   drags, snaps, phase steps or errors.
8. **Hierarchy of timing.** Big surfaces take longest (a window, a
   screen); small things settle fast (a ring arc, a row); a fade is
   quicker than a move; exits are quicker than entries. A cashier reads
   the hierarchy without seeing it: what moved slowly was big.

## 2. The motion presets

`ui/Motion.kt`, beside `ui/Theme.kt`. Springs for anything that moves
through space or can be interrupted (they retarget from the current value
and velocity, which tweens can't); durations only for opacity, where there
is no position to carry. `Spring.StiffnessMedium` is 1500 and
`StiffnessMediumLow` 400 in Compose; these sit around them.

| Preset | Spec | Settles in about | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Motion.surface` | `spring(stiffness = 380f, dampingRatio = 0.86f)` | 450 ms | A window-sized thing arriving or leaving: the panel growing out of the bubble and collapsing back; the enlarged code growing from the sale's code; a screen's container transform (shift row to sale, order card to order page); the sale's code card turning into its paid or ended hero |
| `Motion.settle` | `spring(stiffness = 800f, dampingRatio = 1f)` | 250 ms | Small things finding their place with no bounce: a shift row moving when another arrives or leaves; the status pill resizing when its words change; the panel's buttons changing width; the docked bubble sliding to its slot |
| `Motion.flick` | `spring(stiffness = 600f, dampingRatio = 0.8f)` seeded with the release velocity | 300 ms | What the finger let go of: the bubble snapping to its edge; the grabber springing back; the close sheet settling (Material's own spring is kept) |
| `Motion.sweep` | `spring(stiffness = 170f, dampingRatio = 1f)` | 600 ms | The phase ring's arc growing a quarter: slow enough to be a sweep, overdamped so it never overshoots a quarter mark, and a second step arriving mid-sweep just retargets |
| `Motion.fade` | `tween(200, LinearEasing)` | 200 ms | Crossfades between two faces of the same thing: the bubble's content, the status words, a row's badge, the paid hero's icon |
| `Motion.fadeQuick` | `tween(120, LinearEasing)` | 120 ms | Exits under something that is arriving, and every crossfade under reduced motion |
| `Motion.pulse` | `tween(1600, LinearOutSlowInEasing)`, repeating | loop | The lit bubble's pulse, only while a code waits and the panel is down |
| `Motion.glints` | `tween(GLINT_MS, LinearEasing)`, repeating | loop | The loading mark (unchanged) |
| `Motion.Dwell.paid` | `5_000 ms` | — | How long a paid moment is held before the till moves on: the sale screen stepping back to the shift (`TillNav.PAID_STEP_BACK_MS`), the panel lowering, the bubble staying green and the chip its tick (`Bubble.PAID_MS`, today 4 s; see M9) |

Rules: `visibilityThreshold` is set for every spring on an `IntOffset`,
`Dp` or `Float` in pixels (`IntOffset.VisibilityThreshold`, 0.5 px), so a
spring doesn't run invisible tails. Any new preset is added to this table
and to `Motion.kt` together, with a purpose, not a value, as its name.
Nothing in a call site reads like `tween(300)`.

Reduced motion (section 7): `Motion.reduced` (a `CompositionLocal` set
once, under the theme) turns `surface`, `settle`, `flick` and `sweep` into
`snap()`, `fade` into `fadeQuick`, and the loops off.

## 3. The spatial model

What the cashier's mind holds, from the back of the screen to the front.
A transition is right when it keeps this model true.

```text
Square (another app)
  └─ the bubble: lives on an edge; the cashier put it there
       └─ the panel: the bubble, opened. Phone: hangs from the top edge with the
          bubble docked at its top corner; tablet: a card beside the bubble
            └─ the order: the panel's order line, opened to fill the panel
Monokular (the app), in front of everything
  └─ the shift: the list; every sale is a row
       └─ a sale: its row, opened. Live: the code; otherwise its page
            ├─ the code, enlarged: the code card, grown to the screen
            ├─ the order: the order card, grown to the page
            └─ the close sheet: rises from the bottom over the sale
  └─ Settings: a different place, so it fades through, not out of anything
```

Continuity map, each thing's origin and destination:

| Thing | Comes from | Goes back to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone panel | the docked bubble's circle (grows out of it, the free bubble having slid into the dock) | the docked bubble, which slides back to the edge |
| Tablet panel | its corner nearest the bubble | the same corner |
| The order, in the panel | the panel's order line (the card grows to the window) | the order line |
| A sale screen (cashier opened it) | its row in the shift | its row |
| A sale screen (a new sale came up by itself) | the shift, rising a little (no row exists yet) | its row, which now exists |
| Enlarged code | the sale's code card | the code card |
| Order page (app) | the sale's order card | the order card |
| Paid / ended page | the sale screen in place: the code card becomes the hero circle | its row, after the dwell |
| Close sheet | the bottom edge | the bottom edge |
| Settings | fades through | fades through to where it was opened |
| Onboarding steps | the next step slides in from the end, the last out to the start | reversed |

## 4. Opportunities

Numbered M1 onward; each says where (file and composable), the motion
from and to, what happens when it's interrupted, what it does under
reduced motion, and why a cashier is better off. "Track" names the
developer: dev1 is the overlay, dev2 the app's screens; the tech lead owns
`Motion.kt` and the measurements.

### Overlay (dev1)

**M1. The panel grows out of the bubble, and collapses back into it.**
`overlay/Overlay.kt` (`addPanel`, `removePanel`, `addBubble`,
`removeBubble`), `overlay/Faces.kt` (`PhonePanel`, `FloatingPanel`,
`PanelCard`).
- Today: `wm.addView` / `removeViewImmediate`; the panel pops in at full
  size and vanishes; on a phone the free bubble window vanishes and a
  docked bubble appears in another place in the same frame.
- Phone, raise: the panel window is added with its content at progress 0
  (invisible) on its first frame. The docked bubble starts where the free
  bubble was (the window hands the last `params` position across) and
  springs to its dock slot (`Motion.settle`); the panel card scales and
  fades up from the dock slot (`graphicsLayer { scaleX; scaleY; alpha;
  transformOrigin }`, pivot at the docked bubble's centre, scale from 0.3,
  alpha reaching 1 by a third of the way, `Motion.surface`). The free
  bubble window is removed on the frame the panel window has drawn, never
  before, so there is no frame with no bubble.
- Phone, lower: the reverse. The free bubble window is added back at the
  edge slot *before* the panel window is removed, and the panel window
  goes on the frame after the free bubble has drawn: the handoff is
  pixel-identical. The shadow, grabber and header collapse with the card;
  nothing inside the card animates separately.
- Tablet: the floating panel scales and fades up from the corner of the
  card nearest the bubble (pivot clamped to the card's bounds; see the
  rejected list for why not the bubble itself). The free bubble stays.
  When the bubble sits at the end edge at the panel's height, the panel
  covers it (`before-tablet-panel.webp`); the grow from that corner is
  then literally from the bubble, and a tap on the panel's grabber or
  beside it still lowers it, so nothing is lost; QA has the overlap as a
  finding (decision 90).
- Interruption: one `Animatable` `raise` in 0..1 per panel window; a tap on
  the bubble, the grabber or beside the panel mid-animation retargets it
  (`animateTo` from the current value and velocity). A sale ending or the
  app coming to the front while raising collapses from wherever it is. A
  configuration change (fold, split screen, rotation) that swaps the
  panel's kind (decision 89) snaps: that is the system moving things, not
  the cashier.
- Reduced motion: snap to open or closed; the bubble handoff is as above.
- Why: the panel is the bubble opened; today it is an unrelated thing that
  appears. A cashier glancing from the customer to the screen finds the
  panel where their eye already was, at the bubble.

**M2. The grabber's fling carries into the collapse.** `Faces.kt`
(`PanelCard`, `Grabber`), `Panel.lowers`.
- Today: the panel follows the finger (`offset {}` on an `Animatable`),
  springs back short of the rule, and vanishes past it.
- Past the rule: `raise.animateTo(0f, Motion.surface, initialVelocity =
  -velocity / height)` from the current drag offset: the panel keeps
  moving in the finger's direction for the first frames while it shrinks
  toward the dock, so a fling reads as the panel being thrown away. The
  drag offset is kept (it is part of the layer's translation) and decays
  with the progress. Short of the rule: `drag.animateTo(0f, Motion.flick,
  initialVelocity = velocity)`.
- Tablet: the drag fades the card (decision 65); past the rule the fade
  completes with the same collapse spring, seeded the same way.
- Interruption: a new touch on the grabber during the spring-back stops
  it (`draggable` already does, since `snapTo` runs on the same
  `Animatable`).
- Reduced motion: no spring-back, the panel snaps to 0 or closes.
- Why: a fling today ends in a cut; the energy the cashier put in should
  go somewhere.

**M3. The bubble's edge snap is a spring with the finger's velocity.**
`Overlay.kt` (`BubbleFrame.snap`).
- Today: `ValueAnimator.ofInt` with `duration = 120 + distance / 6`, no
  velocity, and `updateViewLayout` per frame.
- A `VelocityTracker` (`android.view`, no dependency) on the drag; on
  release, a Compose `Animatable` on the window's x (in a coroutine on
  `AndroidUiDispatcher.Main`, which has the frame clock) with
  `Motion.flick` seeded with the x velocity; `updateViewLayout` stays the
  way the window moves (it is how every floating bubble on Android moves,
  and it already runs per `MOVE` event), but it is now driven by the
  frame clock, so it never runs a frame the display can't show. The y is
  clamped as today.
- Interruption: a touch down during the snap cancels the job and the
  finger has the bubble.
- Reduced motion: the window jumps to the edge.
- Why: the snap should feel like letting go of something, not a timer.

**M4. The bubble changes face without changing bubble.** `Faces.kt`
(`BubbleFace`, `Circle`).
- Today: three different `Box`es by `look`; idle to lit to paid are hard
  swaps, and the paid look is a different composable with a different
  shadow.
- One circle that stays; its alpha (0.55 to 1), elevation (4 to 6 dp) and
  ground colour (white to `paidGround`) animate (`Motion.fade`, read in
  `graphicsLayer`/`drawBehind`); its content crossfades (`Crossfade`-style
  with `Motion.fade`): the grey logo, the ring with its pupil, the tick.
  The appear and disappear of the whole bubble (shift start and stop, the
  app going to the front and back) scale and fade the circle inside its
  window (0.6 to 1, `Motion.surface`) rather than the window popping; the
  window is added at progress 0 and removed after the exit finishes.
- The paid moment (with M6): the ring's arc closes to the full circle in
  `paid` green and the pupil crossfades to the tick, ground to
  `paidGround`; after `Motion.Dwell.paid` it crossfades back to lit or
  idle. One `CONFIRM` haptic at the moment it lands (section 6).
- The pulse: runs only while the shown sale is Waiting or Partial and the
  panel is down (it is a call to raise the panel); it stops when the panel
  is up (the docked bubble doesn't pulse) and once the payment is seen.
  Its ring is drawn in `drawBehind` as today. The window's padding is
  raised from 12 to 16 dp so the pulse's outer edge (28 + 16 dp) isn't
  clipped by the window, which it is today by 4 dp.
- Interruption: `Crossfade` retargets; a paid that arrives mid-pulse just
  stops the pulse at its current alpha and fades it.
- Reduced motion: no pulse; faces swap with `fadeQuick`.
- PR #18 note: #18 puts the loading mark's glints back in the lit bubble
  in place of the ring. If it lands first, the lit face is the mark and
  the paid face is mark-to-tick; the pulse and the glints must then share
  one `rememberInfiniteTransition` so the window has one invalidation
  stream, not two. M4's structure (one circle, crossfaded content) is the
  same either way; dev1 keeps `BubbleFace`'s signature and puts the new
  motion in private composables, so the merge is a content swap.
- Why: the bubble is one object the cashier placed; it mustn't look
  replaced.

**M5. The panel's faces, and its order page, come from where they were.**
`Faces.kt` (`Face`, `Buttons`, `PhonePanel`, `FloatingPanel`),
`Overlay.kt` (`PanelPage`).
- Code to order: today `PhonePanel` returns a different tree. Now one
  outer container (shadow, clip, ground) whose bounds animate from the
  card to the window (phone) or from the card's height to the order's
  (tablet) with `Motion.surface` (`AnimatedContent` with a
  `SizeTransform`, or `animateContentSize` on the container), the corner
  radius 32 to 0 dp on a phone read in `graphicsLayer { shape }`, the
  content crossfading (`Motion.fade`, the code out under `fadeQuick`); the
  docked bubble fades out as the order fills the window and back in on
  return. The order line is where the eye lands first after the swap
  (it is at the top of the order page's list in the same place).
- Live to paid, in place: the code card scales down into the 88 dp paid
  hero at the same centre (one layer: the white card with its corner
  radius growing to a circle in `graphicsLayer`, the QR image fading out
  under `fadeQuick` while the tick fades in; `Motion.surface`), the
  status row crossfades to "Paid" and "… XMR received"; the buttons row
  crossfades two to one with its width settling (`Motion.settle`). The
  sale is paid, so nothing scans during this; principle 3 still holds
  because the bitmap never re-lays out.
- Live to ended: the same collapse into the 88 dp ended circle on
  `warnGround` or `dangerGround`.
- Paid to the next waiting sale (seen in `before-overlay2.mp4`: with
  more sales waiting, the panel doesn't lower after the dwell, the focus
  moves on and the next code comes up in it, decision 85): the paid hero
  grows back out into the next sale's white code card at the same centre,
  the header, amount and order line crossfading; the container stays.
  Only with nothing waiting does the panel collapse into the bubble (M1).
- Interruption: all `Transition`-based, so a second change (paid during
  the order page, say) retargets from the current frame.
- Reduced motion: `fadeQuick` swaps, the container snaps to size.
- Why: the panel's content is three different layouts today; the cashier
  sees a page replace a page. With the container persisting and only the
  content changing, it's one panel showing the next thing.

**M6. The phase ring sweeps.** `ui/PhaseRing.kt`; every place it draws:
the bubble, the panel's status row, the sale's status pill, the enlarged
code's foot, a shift row's badge, the close sheet's "Yes" glyph.
- Today: `ringFill(phase)` jumps a quarter.
- `animateFloatAsState(ringFill(phase), Motion.sweep)` read inside the
  `Canvas` draw lambda only (the composable's parameters don't change per
  frame, so nothing recomposes). The first composition starts at the
  phase's own fill, never from 0, so a ring that appears already at Seen
  doesn't sweep in. At Paid the arc completes the circle in `paid` green
  (the fill colour crossfades over the last quarter, in `drawBehind`).
- Interruption: Seen then Confirming within the sweep retargets; the
  spring is overdamped so it never passes a quarter mark.
- Reduced motion: snaps, as today.
- Not the status bar chip: Android draws the promoted notification's icon
  itself from the four vector drawables (decision 68); it steps, and
  that's the system's.
- Why: the sweep is the one thing that says "something is happening on
  the network" without words, in a cashier's peripheral vision.

### The app's screens (dev2)

**M7. Navigation has direction, and things open from where they are.**
`MainActivity.kt` (the bare `when (screen)`), `ui/Shift.kt` (`SaleRow`),
`ui/Till.kt` (`LiveSale`, `Code`, `OrderCard`), `ui/CodeScreen.kt`,
`ui/OrderPage.kt`, `ui/SaleDetail.kt`.
- Today: every screen change is a cut.
- One `SharedTransitionLayout` around one `AnimatedContent(targetState =
  screen)` in `MainActivity`, keyed so a `Sale(id)` turning into
  `Code(id)` is a transition and `Sale(a)` to `Sale(b)` is one too. The
  transition by pair:
  - Shift to sale, cashier's tap: the row's card is the sale's surface
    (`sharedBounds("sale/$id")` on the row's rounded background and on the
    sale screen's root, `Motion.surface`), content crossfading; Back
    returns it into the row if the row is on screen, else the plain back
    below.
  - Shift to sale, a new sale coming up by itself (`TillNav.follow`): the
    sale fades in and settles from 0.94 scale (`Motion.surface`, enter
    only, the shift fading under it with `fadeQuick`); there is no row to
    grow from, and it mustn't look like something the cashier did.
  - Sale to code (M8), sale to order page: the order card is the page's
    list card (`sharedBounds("order/$id")`), the rest crossfades.
  - Code or order back to sale, sale back to shift: the reverse of how
    they came.
  - Anything to Settings and back: fade-through (exit `fadeQuick`, enter
    `fade` from 0.96 scale). Settings is a different place.
  - Onboarding steps: the next step slides in from the end over 30% of
    the width with `fade`, the last slides out to the start by 10%; Back
    reverses. Done once per device, so no more than that.
- Predictive back: `PredictiveBackHandler` drives a
  `SeekableTransitionState` for the back transition of each pair, so the
  code shrinks toward its card, the sale toward its row, as the gesture
  progresses; commit finishes with `Motion.surface`, cancel springs back.
  The existing `BackHandler` rules (which screens handle Back, `back(from)`
  only if still on screen, decision 77) are unchanged; the gesture never
  changes state until commit.
- Interruption: `AnimatedContent` and `SeekableTransitionState` retarget;
  `TillNav` moving the screen mid-transition (a sale paid while opening)
  is just the next target.
- Reduced motion: every pair is a `fadeQuick` crossfade; predictive back
  shows no preview (the handler still commits).
- Why: the shift is a list of sales and a sale is a row opened; today
  nothing says so. Direction tells the cashier whether they went deeper or
  came back without reading the header.

**M8. The code enlarges from the code.** `ui/Till.kt` (`Code`),
`ui/CodeScreen.kt` (`CodeScreen`, `FullBrightness`), `ui/Qr.kt` (`QrCode`).
- Today: a cut to a white screen; brightness and bar icons change in the
  same frame. In the dark theme it is the harshest cut in the app, a
  near-black ground to full white (`before-code-paid.mp4` at 0:08), and
  the shrink is the same in reverse.
- The white card is the shared element: `sharedBounds("code-card/$id")`
  on the sale's `QrCode` card and on `CodeScreen`'s white root, so the
  white ground spreads from the card's bounds to the screen
  (`Motion.surface`); the QR image inside is `sharedElement("code/$id")`
  with `ScaleToBounds`, so it is laid out once at the target size and
  scaled as a layer between the two sizes: no re-layout, no re-encode, a
  valid code every frame (principle 3). The sale's amount, pill and
  buttons fade out under it (`fadeQuick`); the enlarged screen's header
  row and foot fade in (`fade`) once the ground is past them. The 32 dp
  expand badge fades out at once. Back and the shrink button reverse it;
  the tap-anywhere does too; predictive back seeks it (M7).
- Brightness: `screenBrightness` is set once, on the first frame, as
  today. Android's `DisplayPowerController` ramps a window brightness
  override itself; the tech lead measures on the device whether the ramp
  is visible, and only if it is a jump does `FullBrightness` animate the
  attribute, and then with at most six steps over the transition (each
  `window.attributes = …` is a relayout request; it must never be per
  frame). The status and navigation bar icons flip at the midpoint.
- The code never gets smaller than its rest size on either screen; the
  shrink ends exactly at 264 dp.
- Interruption: a paid or expiry during the enlarge is `TillNav` moving
  the screen: the shared element retargets into the sale's page (the
  card becomes the hero, M10).
- Reduced motion: `fadeQuick` crossfade, white to white.
- Why: the customer is already reaching for the code when the cashier
  taps it; growing it in place keeps their camera where it was.

**M9. The paid moment is one moment, everywhere, for the same time.**
`ui/Till.kt` (`SaleScreen`), `ui/SaleDetail.kt`, `Faces.kt`
(`SalePanel`'s `delay(5_000)`), `SaleText.kt` (`Bubble.PAID_MS`,
`TillNav.PAID_STEP_BACK_MS`), `TillService.kt`, `notify/SaleNotifications.kt`.
- Today: the bubble is green and the chip a tick for 4 s
  (`Bubble.PAID_MS`); the panel shows paid for 5 s then lowers, or moves
  on to the next waiting sale when the focus moves at 4 s; the sale
  screen steps back after 5 s. So the docked bubble goes back to lit a
  second before the panel it is docked to moves on (`before-overlay2.mp4`
  at 0:24), and a second before it would collapse into it.
- One `Motion.Dwell.paid` (5 s: the acceptance criteria's number) for all
  four. The panel's exit (M1's collapse, or M5's grow into the next
  sale) *is* the end of the moment: at the dwell the panel folds into
  the green bubble, and the bubble fades to lit or idle (`Motion.fade`)
  only once the collapse has landed, driven by the collapse's
  completion, not a second timer; when the next sale comes up instead,
  the bubble fades to lit as the next code grows in. The chip's tick
  goes at the same dwell. The sale screen (M10) steps back into its row
  at the dwell.
- Interruption: Done on the panel, or Back on the sale, ends the dwell
  early and runs the same exit.
- Reduced motion: the dwell is the same; the exits snap.
- Why: a cashier sees the paid bubble, the paid panel, the paid chip and
  the paid page as one event; they must start and end together.

**M10. A sale turns into its page in place, then settles into its row.**
`ui/Till.kt` (`SaleScreen`, `LiveSale`), `ui/SaleDetail.kt`
(`StateBadge`), `ui/Shift.kt` (`SaleRow`).
- Today: `SaleScreen` swaps `LiveSale` for `SaleDetail` in one frame.
- The live sale and its page are two states of one screen (an
  `AnimatedContent` inside `SaleScreen`, or shared elements between the
  two): the white code card collapses into the page's 72 dp hero circle
  at the top centre (`sharedBounds("code-card/$id")` again, its corner
  radius ending at a circle, the QR fading out under `fadeQuick`, the
  tick or clock fading in); the amount moves from under the top bar to
  under the heading (`sharedElement`); the status pill crossfades into
  the heading line; the order card stays where it is if the page keeps
  it. The top bar's X fades out (it isn't offered once the sale isn't
  live, decision 83).
- After `Motion.Dwell.paid` on a paid sale, the page settles into its
  row in the shift (M7's container transform in reverse: the page's
  surface shrinks to the row, which exists now, with the paid tick
  already in it, so the hero visibly becomes the row's badge).
- A close from the sheet: the sheet hides first (as today, decision 83),
  then this.
- Interruption: a reopen ("Show the code again") is the reverse; a paid
  arriving during the ended morph retargets to the paid hero.
- Reduced motion: `fadeQuick` crossfade; the step back is a crossfade.
- Why: "the sale got paid" is the one event a cashier must not miss, and
  today it's a cut to a different-looking page. A code folding into a
  tick is unmistakable from across the counter.

**M11. The shift list moves rows, not the cashier's eye.** `ui/Shift.kt`
(`ShiftScreen`, `SaleRow`, `Chips`).
- `Modifier.animateItem(fadeInSpec = Motion.fade, placementSpec =
  Motion.settle, fadeOutSpec = Motion.fadeQuick)` on every row: a new
  sale slides the others down; a filter change moves the rows that stay
  and fades the rest; a row leaving (a sale carried off at a new shift)
  fades. Keys are already `orderId`.
- A row's badge (ring to tick, ring to clock) crossfades (`Motion.fade`);
  its ring sweeps (M6); the words change without motion (text is read,
  not watched); the row's corner shape, which depends on its index,
  snaps (animating it would need a layout per frame of every row for
  nothing).
- Interruption: `animateItem` handles retargeting.
- Reduced motion: `animateItem` specs are `snap()`.
- Why: with several sales up, a new row arriving at the top today
  displaces everything by a row in one frame, and the cashier loses the
  one they were reading.

**M12. Words that change under a steady eye crossfade, and numbers don't
jitter.** `ui/Till.kt` (`StatusPill`), `Faces.kt` (`StatusRow`),
`ui/CodeScreen.kt` (`CodeText.under`), `ui/OrderPage.kt` (`ShowCodeBar`),
`ui/CloseSheet.kt` (`Answer`), `ui/Theme.kt`.
- The status words ("Waiting for payment" to "Seen on the network" to
  "Confirming") crossfade (`AnimatedContent` with `Motion.fade`) and the
  pill they sit in settles to the new width (`animateContentSize(Motion.
  settle)`); the pill is a two-text subtree, so a layout per frame of it
  is nothing.
- Every countdown ("14:52 left") is set in tabular figures: one
  `TextStyle` in `Theme.kt` (`tabular`, `FontFeatureSettings "tnum"`),
  used wherever `SaleText.clock` is shown, so the digits tick without the
  text shifting. The tick itself is a state change once a second and
  recomposes that text alone (as today); it is never animated.
- Reduced motion: words snap.
- Why: a cashier watching the pill for "Seen" sees the moment it changes
  instead of a flicker, and the countdown stops wobbling beside it.

### Shared (tech lead)

**M13. `ui/Motion.kt` and one reduced-motion switch.** Section 2's
presets; `Motion.reduced` as a `CompositionLocal` provided in
`MonokularTheme` from a `ContentObserver` on
`Settings.Global.ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` (so a change takes effect
without restarting the app, and the three composables that each call
`Settings.Global.getFloat` on first composition today (`LoadingMark`,
`Circle`, `PanelCard`) stop doing a Binder call each). The existing
`reducedMotion()` becomes a read of that local. Compose already scales
its frame clock by the animator duration scale on API 33+ (so "Remove
animations" snaps every spring and tween by itself); the local is what
turns loops off and swaps spatial transforms for fades on every API.

**M14. Measurements, before and after.** Section 8.

## 5. Rejected

Each was considered and cut, with the reason, so it isn't raised again
without a new argument.

- **Window animations (`windowAnimations` styles) for the panel and
  bubble.** Free of per-frame cost, but not interruptible, not seeded by
  velocity, and they can't start from the bubble's position. M1 does it in
  the window's own Compose tree instead.
- **A true origin at the tablet's bubble.** The floating panel's window
  is only as big as the card plus its shadow; scaling about a pivot
  outside it would be clipped, and making the window full-screen would
  take every touch meant for Square (an overlay window with
  `FLAG_NOT_TOUCH_MODAL` still owns touches inside its bounds). The pivot
  is the card's nearest corner, which reads as "toward the bubble".
- **Animating brightness by hand.** A `window.attributes` write is a
  relayout request; doing it per frame is exactly the kind of code the
  owner ruled out. The system ramps overrides itself; measure first (M8).
- **Any motion on the QR modules, a fade-in of the code, a redraw as it
  scales, or a "scan me" shimmer.** Principle 3. The code is a bitmap
  scaled as one layer, nothing else, ever.
- **A status bar chip that sweeps.** Android draws it from the four
  vector drawables (decision 68); animating it would mean posting
  notifications per frame.
- **Chip selection colour fades, the "Needs action" count appearing with a
  pop, the Watching dot changing colour slowly.** Discrete states the
  cashier reads, not watches; a fade would only make them look slower.
- **Staggered entrance of the order's lines, the shift's rows or
  onboarding's features.** Decoration that delays reading.
- **A count-up on amounts.** A cashier reads a number once; it must be
  the number the first time.
- **Button press scales, ripple replacements, a shaking refund button on
  error.** Material's ripples are enough and are the platform's.
- **A loading spinner replacing the loading mark; a progress bar for the
  countdown.** The mark exists; the countdown is a number by design.
- **A pulsing "Paid" or a confetti/particle moment.** The paid moment is
  the ring closing and the tick arriving (M4, M10) and one haptic; a
  louder celebration would be noticed, which is the opposite of the goal.
- **Animating the bubble's y while it is dragged, or an inertial drag.**
  The finger has it; it must be exactly under the finger.
- **A `Modifier.animateContentSize` on the panel card for every content
  change.** It would re-measure the whole card (and the QR's `Image`)
  per frame on every tick of the countdown that changes the status
  width. Only the status pill (M12) and the container swaps (M5) animate
  size, and the QR is never inside a size-animating node.
- **Launching the app from the panel with a scale-up `ActivityOptions`
  from the code's bounds** (`makeScaleUpAnimation`): tried in thought;
  Android 12+ draws its own launch (the splash and task animation) and
  ignores a scale-up from a non-activity source, and the app opens on the
  shift, not on the code, so there is nothing for it to grow into. Left
  to the system.
- **The idle shift's faded logo breathing.** It is a placeholder, not a
  state the cashier waits on.
- **`androidx.dynamicanimation` or Material motion libraries.** No new
  dependencies; Compose's springs are the same physics.

## 6. Haptics

One `HapticFeedbackConstants.CONFIRM` (API 30+, else `CONTEXT_CLICK`) when
a payment lands, performed by the surface the cashier is looking at and
by it alone: the bubble's window when the overlay is up (the app isn't on
screen), the sale screen when the app is (the panel and bubble aren't
shown while the app is visible, so there is no double). The notification
channels are silent (`setSilent`), so there is no second buzz from the
shade. `performHapticFeedback` on the view respects the system's haptic
settings, so nothing is added for that. Nothing else buzzes: not the
grabber, not the snap, not the sheet, not a phase step, not an error (the
words and the red do that).

## 7. Reduced motion

One switch, `Motion.reduced` (M13), true when the animator duration scale
is 0 ("Remove animations" in Accessibility, or the developer option).
Then:

- Loops (pulse, glints) don't run; the bubble and mark are still.
- Spatial presets (`surface`, `settle`, `flick`, `sweep`) are `snap()`.
- Crossfades are `fadeQuick` (120 ms): a crossfade is not motion, and a
  hard cut between a white screen and a dark one is harsher than a short
  fade for the people who ask for this.
- Predictive back shows no preview; Back still works.
- `animateItem` specs are `snap()`.
- Dwells (`Dwell.paid`) are unchanged: they are reading time, not motion.

A scale of 0.5× or 2× is left to Compose's frame clock scaling, which
every preset goes through on API 33+.

## 8. Measuring

Before numbers are taken on the base commit and after numbers on the
integration branch, by the tech lead, on the same device, and kept in
`docs/reports/motion/baseline.md` (before, with the scripts and the
emulator caveats) and `docs/reports/motion/after.md`. The emulators here run software GL
(`swangle`) on a host whose load average passed 60 during this round
(the app ANR'd on its first frame once, and a frame took 9 s), so their
frame times say whether something is *wrong*, not how it *feels*; the
final numbers come from a physical device, and from emulators only with
the host idle and compared before to after on the same instance.

| What | How | Flows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frame timing | `adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo app.monokular.debug reset`, run the flow ten times, `dumpsys gfxinfo app.monokular.debug framestats`: janky frames %, 90th/95th/99th percentile | panel raise and lower ×10; code enlarge and shrink ×10; shift to sale and back ×10; a paid moment ×3; a new sale arriving on the shift with five rows ×5 |
| Memory | `dumpsys meminfo app.monokular.debug` after each flow, at rest 10 s later: PSS total, Graphics, Java heap | the same flows; the overlay windows up and down |
| APK size | `app-release.apk` (minified) and the debug APK, bytes | before and after |
| Recomposition | Layout Inspector's recomposition counts on `PanelCard`, `QrCode`, `PhaseRing`, `SaleRow`, `StatusPill` during each flow; the target is zero per frame of animation | the same flows |
| Allocation | Android Studio's allocation tracker over one panel raise and one enlarge: no allocations inside draw lambdas | two flows |

Pass: no new janky frames over the before run at the 95th percentile on
the device; PSS at rest within 2 MB of before; APK within 50 KB; zero
recompositions per animated frame of the named composables.

## 9. Order of work and tracks

dev1 (overlay): M13's presets first (the tech lead lands `Motion.kt`
within the hour; until then dev1 writes against the names in section 2),
then M6 (the ring is used by both tracks; dev1 owns `PhaseRing.kt`), M4,
M1, M2, M3, M5, M9's overlay half.

dev2 (screens): M12 (small, everywhere), M11, M7, M8, M10, M9's app half.

Tech lead: M13, M14, the integration branch, and decisions 90 onward in
`docs/decisions/android.md` for anything above that is a call rather than
a refinement (M9's dwell is one).

Conflicts to watch: PR #18 touches `BubbleFace` and `Mark.kt` (M4 note);
PR #16 and #17 don't touch these files.

## 10. Performance rules

What every motion commit is reviewed against (the owner's "blazing fast,
memory efficient, no hacky animation code"), in one place so a review says
"rule 3" and not "I'd rather". Decisions 91 to 97 say why.

1. **Animated values are read in draw or layout only**: `graphicsLayer {}`,
   `drawBehind {}`, `Modifier.offset {}`, a `Canvas` lambda, a
   `Modifier.Node`. A composable's parameters never change per frame.
   `QrCode`, `PhaseRing`, `PanelCard`, `SaleRow` and `StatusPill` recompose
   zero times per animated frame (Layout Inspector's counts).
2. **Nothing is allocated per frame**: no lambdas, `Path`s, `Shape`s,
   `String`s or data classes inside a draw or animation lambda; shapes and
   paths are made once (`MarkPaths` is the model).
3. **One frame clock, Compose's.** No `ValueAnimator`, `Handler.postDelayed`,
   `delay()`-chained choreography, reflection or hand-rolled loops. A motion
   that needs "wait, then" is two motions, or one driven by the other's
   progress or completion.
4. **Every spec is a named preset** from `ui/Motion.kt` (`motion.surface`,
   `settle`, `flick`, `sweep`, `fade`, `fadeQuick`, `pulse`, `glints`,
   `Motion.Dwell.PAID_MS`), through `.fraction`, `.px` or `.spec(threshold)`.
   A literal duration, stiffness or threshold at a call site fails review.
   Springs for anything with a position; tweens only for opacity.
5. **Every transition is interruptible and keeps its velocity**:
   `Animatable.animateTo` from the current value with `initialVelocity`;
   `Transition`, `AnimatedContent` and `SeekableTransitionState` retarget.
   Nothing blocks input. The payment code is scannable on every frame.
6. **The code is one bitmap, scaled as one layer.** Encoded once per text
   (`codeBitmap`), laid out once, moved only by `sharedElement` with
   `ScaleToBounds` or a `graphicsLayer` scale; never inside an
   `animateContentSize` node, never re-laid out, re-encoded, faded in or
   drawn module by module; at rest never below its designed size.
7. **Two loops in the app**: the bubble's pulse and the loading mark's
   glints, each only while something is waited for and visible (the pulse:
   the free bubble, a code Waiting or Partial, the panel down). Two loops in
   one window share one `rememberInfiniteTransition`.
8. **Reduced motion is one switch**: `motion.still` (`Motion.Still` while
   the animator scale is 0, followed live). Loops off, spatial presets
   `snap()`, crossfades `fadeQuick`, predictive back without a preview,
   dwells unchanged. No other read of the animator scale anywhere.
9. **Overlay windows**: made per open, content added at progress 0, removed
   with `removeView` after the exit lands (`removeViewImmediate` only in
   `stop()`). The bubble's x on release is the only window-attribute
   animation (one `updateViewLayout` per frame for about 300 ms); nothing
   else animates window attributes, `screenBrightness` included.
10. **Stable inputs**: `TillActions` and `PanelActions` are `@Immutable` and
    remembered per sale; what a screen reads is hoisted behind
    `derivedStateOf` or `remember` so the root `AnimatedContent` isn't
    handed new lambdas on every poll of the runner.
11. **No new third-party dependency**: androidx compose animation,
    foundation, ui and activity-compose; for tests `ui-test-junit4` and
    `ui-test-manifest`, with `androidx.test:runner` 1.7.0 and
    `espresso-core` 3.7.0 pinned (the ones they bring reflect on
    `InputManager.getInstance`, gone in Android 16). No Robolectric, no
    dynamicanimation, no Material motion library, no BOM bump (2026.09.00
    has everything).
12. **Measured before and after** with the same scripts on the same emulator
    instance in one session (`gfxinfo reset`/`framestats`, `meminfo`,
    `apkanalyzer`), compared as counts and ratios; final numbers on a
    device. Pass: no new janky frames at p95 on the device, PSS at rest
    within 2 MB, APK within 50 KB, zero recompositions per animated frame of
    the composables in rule 1.

## 11. Tech lead amendments

Where the spec met the codebase or the performance rules, what changed and
why, each against the section or item it amends. Decisions 97 to 99 in
`docs/decisions/android.md` record the calls.

1. **Presets are generic over what moves (§2, M13).** A Compose spec is
   typed by its value: `FiniteAnimationSpec<Float>` for a progress,
   `<IntOffset>` for `animateItem`'s placement, `<IntSize>` for
   `animateContentSize`, `<Rect>` for a `boundsTransform`, `<Color>` for a
   ground; one `Motion.surface` value can't be all of them. Each preset is
   a `Preset` with `fraction` (a value in 0..1, finished within a
   thousandth so a full-screen surface never jumps its last pixel), `px`
   (within half a pixel) and `spec(visibilityThreshold)` for the rest. Call
   sites read `motion.surface.fraction`,
   `motion.settle.spec(IntOffset.VisibilityThreshold)`,
   `motion.surface.spec<Rect>()`. §2's thresholds live inside the preset,
   never at a call site.
2. **`Motion.reduced` is `motion.still`, and the reduced presets are a
   second instance (§2, §7, M13).** `Motion.Still` is the same class with
   `snap()` for the spatial presets, the 120 ms tween for `fade`, and
   `pulse` and `glints` null, so a loop can't be started by mistake
   (`rememberInfiniteTransition` needs a spec to run). `MonokularTheme`
   provides `LocalMotion` from `rememberMotion()`, one Binder read per
   window and a `ContentObserver` after; `reducedMotion()` is gone.
3. **`Motion.Dwell.paid` is `Motion.Dwell.PAID_MS` (§2, M9)**, the repo's
   style for a constant with a unit (`FLING_DP_PER_S`, `GLINT_MS`).
   `Bubble.PAID_MS` (4 s) and `TillNav.PAID_STEP_BACK_MS` are removed; the
   panel's, the service's, the overlay's and the view model's timers read
   the one constant now. The rest of M9 (the bubble's fade following the
   panel's collapse) is the tracks'.
4. **Instrumented tests have a harness (§8, decision 95).**
   `ui-test-junit4` and `ui-test-manifest` (androidx, test-only), with
   `AndroidJUnitRunner`; `androidx.test:runner` 1.7.0 and `espresso-core`
   3.7.0 are pinned because the versions `ui-test-junit4` brings fail on
   API 36 (`NoSuchMethodException: InputManager.getInstance`) before any
   test runs. `app/src/androidTest/` holds the foundation's two tests,
   green on `Pixel_9_Pro_motion` (emulator-5558); the tracks add theirs
   beside them and run `connectedDebugAndroidTest` on their emulator
   before a PR.
5. **The code's bitmap cache is in the foundation (M5, M8, decision 96).**
   `codeBitmap(text)` in `Qr.kt` keeps the last four codes, so the sale
   screen, the enlarged code, the panel and a shared element between them
   get one `ImageBitmap` for one text; `QrCode` reads it already. Both
   tracks' shared elements need it, so neither waits for the other.
6. **The handoff frame is a pre-draw listener (M1).** "The free bubble
   window is removed on the frame the panel window has drawn" is
   `View.doOnPreDraw` (core-ktx; one listener that removes itself) on the
   panel's view, and the same on the free bubble's view for the lower; not
   a post, not a delay. Both windows are added at progress 0, so the
   pre-draw frame shows nothing either way.
7. **The bubble's snap runs on the UI dispatcher (M3).** An `Animatable`
   needs a `MonotonicFrameClock` in its coroutine context, which
   `lifecycleScope` doesn't carry: the snap is
   `scope.launch(AndroidUiDispatcher.Main)` on the overlay's existing
   scope (the dispatcher that ticks with the Choreographer), and the next
   `ACTION_DOWN` cancels the job. No scope per bubble, no
   `GlobalScope`.
8. **PR #18 and the bubble (M4).** `BubbleFace(look, pulse, phase)` keeps
   its signature; when #18 lands, its loading mark's glints and the pulse
   share the bubble's one `rememberInfiniteTransition`. dev1 reads #18's
   diff before starting M4 and says in the PR what will conflict.
9. **`AnimatedContent`'s key is the `Screen` itself (M7).** The screens
   are data classes, so the default `contentKey` already makes `Sale(a)`
   to `Sale(b)` a transition and `Sale(a)` to `Sale(a)` with new sales
   none. No custom key.
10. **One clock per screen (M12).** One `LaunchedEffect` ticking a
    `mutableLongStateOf` at the screen's root, handed down as a
    `State<Long>` and read only inside the `Text` that shows the
    countdown, so a tick recomposes those texts and nothing above them;
    `secondsLeft(expiresAt)` with its own effect per text goes.
11. **Who owns the shared files (§9).** dev1: `overlay/*`, `ui/PhaseRing.kt`
    (M6, used by both), `ui/Mark.kt`, `TillService.kt`. dev2: `ui/Parts.kt`,
    `ui/Qr.kt`, `ui/Theme.kt`, `ui/Till.kt`, `SaleText.kt`,
    `MainActivity.kt`, `AppViewModel.kt` and the rest of `ui/`. The lead:
    `ui/Motion.kt`, `notify/SaleNotifications.kt`, the docs and the
    numbers. A change needed in the other track's file is asked of its
    owner, not made.
