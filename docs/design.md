# Monokular: companion app, POS integration and push

Monokular is the iPhone, iPad and Android app that sits next to a point of
sale (Square first) and shows the customer a Monero payment code when the
cashier takes a Monero sale. The code can carry the whole receipt, so the
customer's wallet keeps it with the payment. This document covers what the
app needs from [monokulo](https://github.com/OceanEilonwy/monokulo), the
Monokular Bell that wakes tills up, and the design of the app itself. Paths
under `crates/` in §5 and §8 refer to the monokulo repository; §9 is the
layout of this one.

1. [The sale flow](#1-the-sale-flow): the till talks to Square; monokulo
   never does.
2. [Connected apps](#2-connected-apps): how a device connects to one store on
   a self-hosted monokulo, and the order API it shares with shop plugins.
3. [Wake-ups](#3-wake-ups): what makes a till check Square, from a timer or
   the Monokular Bell.
4. [The receipt](#4-the-receipt): built on the till, carried in the code.
5. [Push](#5-push): a reusable `push` crate, Web Push everywhere,
   UnifiedPush, and a `push-relay` crate for APNs and FCM.

## 1. The sale flow

### Principles

- **The till holds the Square connection, not monokulo.** Monokulo has no
  Square permission, no Square settings and no Square code. It learns an
  amount and an opaque reference, nothing else, on the public instance and on
  every self-hosted one.
- **What someone bought never leaves the till except in the QR code** (§4).
- **Self-hosters set up nothing for Square.** Tills sign in to Square through
  the project's Square application; any monokulo works with it.
- **Monokulo stays POS-agnostic, and app-agnostic.** Another POS is app work
  only, and monokulo keeps no list of apps, as it keeps none of shop plugins.

### Why the cashier tenders "Other: Monero"

Square doesn't expose a sale rung up in Square Point of Sale until it has been
tendered, and a third party can't add a payment to a POS-created order or
complete it (`UpdateOrder` can't touch POS orders; the "open orders" alpha is
closed to new apps). So the cashier tenders with a custom payment type and
the till reconciles.

### Flow

```text
cashier: rings up in Square POS ─▶ taps "Other: Monero" ─▶ Square closes the sale
till:    woken by a timer or the Monokular Bell (§3)
         GET Square payments since its cursor, at its location
         ─▶ a new payment whose Other tender is "Monero"
         GET /v2/orders/{order_id} (line items, for the receipt)
         POST monokulo /api/v1/orders   (§2: the create-order form, with the app's key)
              { amount, currency, merchant_order_id, idempotency_key }
         ◀─ 201 { order_id, status, address, xmr_amount_piconero, expires_at, _links.self }
         payment URI = monero:{address}?tx_amount={XMR}
         orf_codec::query::append(payment URI, receipt) (§4)
         shows amount + code (Slide Over / bubble / app; Live Activity on iPhone)
customer pays ─▶ engine: order.unconfirmed ─▶ order.confirming ─▶ order.paid
monokulo ─▶ SSE / push "sale.seen" / "sale.confirming" / "sale.paid" (§5)
never paid ─▶ order.expired ─▶ "sale.expired" ─▶ the till offers
         "Refund the Square sale" (RefundPayment with its own token,
         or the cashier refunds in POS)
```

Nothing is written back to Square when the payment arrives: the Square sale
was recorded as "Monero" when the cashier tapped it. The only write is the
refund of a sale that never pays.

### Sales from Square, on the till

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Square application | One, owned by the project. Tills use it unless they're connected to a self-hosted Bell, which brings its own (§3) |
| Sign-in | OAuth with PKCE on the device: no secret anywhere. Redirect to `https://monokular.monokulo.com/square`, an App Link / universal link, so Square hands the code straight back to the app |
| Scopes | `PAYMENTS_READ` (find sales), `ORDERS_READ` (items for the receipt), `MERCHANT_PROFILE_READ` (pick the till's location), `PAYMENTS_WRITE` (refund a sale that never pays) |
| Tokens | Kept in the Keystore / Keychain, never sent to monokulo. PKCE refresh tokens are single-use and expire (90 days at the time of writing; the spike confirms): the app refreshes on every use and asks for a new sign-in when one lapses |
| Finding sales | `ListPayments` for the till's location since a saved cursor (`begin_time`, plus payment ids already handled) |
| Filter | Other tender whose name is the configured one (default "Monero"); status `COMPLETED` |
| Which till | The till's location, and its own `device_details` when Square gives them; otherwise every Monokular at the location shows the sale |
| Two tills, one sale | `idempotency_key` is `sq:` plus a hash of the Square payment id, so every till that finds it gets the same order |
| Sandbox | Square's sandbox can't run Square POS: verify with $0 Other tenders on a real account |

Say on the Square sign-in screen what it allows: `ORDERS_READ` lets the till
read every order of the business, not just Monero sales. That's the right
place for it, a device the merchant controls, but it should be said.

### POS sources

A POS is a **sale source** in the app: "the new Monero sales since my
cursor", plus "refund this one". Square is the first. Another POS adds a
source (and, if it has webhooks, a Bell receiver, §3); monokulo, the receipt,
wake-ups and the screens don't change.

---

## 2. Connected apps

Monokulo already connects **shop plugins** (`http::connect`, the Shop plugins
page on the Pages site): any plugin names itself with a slug and a name,
monokulo keeps no list of them, and the plugin then makes orders with
Monokulo's HTTP API (`/api/v1`). Connected apps follow the same rules and use
the same API, but they connect differently, because a till isn't a shop.
Monokulo's docs (`/api/` and `/apps/`) and its OpenAPI document are the
source of truth; the app's contract test runs against that document,
generated from a pinned Monokulo commit (§9).

| | Shop plugin | Connected app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Names itself | slug + name (`plugins::PluginSlug`, `PluginName`) | The same types and rules: `monokular`, "Monokular" |
| Per store | One: connecting a plugin closes the active one | Many, one per device |
| Starts from | The shop: the browser goes to `/connect/{slug}?site_url=…`, and the shop's host finds the store | The store's dashboard: a single-use connect code |
| Credentials | The store's secret key (`sk_…`) | The device's own `app_key` (`ak_…`), revocable on its own |
| Makes orders | The `create-order` form, `POST /api/v1/orders` | The same |
| Hears about them | Signed webhooks to the shop | SSE and Web Push (§5): a till can't take webhooks |

The plugin flow can't be reused as it is: a till has no shop host, and
connecting it as the store's plugin would disconnect the shop's WooCommerce
plugin.

### Web

- **Store settings › Connected apps** (a card beside Connections, where the
  store's plugin stays): every connected device, as the app named itself
  plus the device's name ("Monokular · Front Counter iPad"), last seen, and
  Disconnect.
- **Connect an app**: a device name, then a single-use connect code (QR) and
  the same as a link with a Copy button, for when the dashboard is open on
  the till itself. The page names no app. Without JavaScript the "waiting"
  line is a Refresh button.

### The connect code

```text
https://pay.yourshop.com/apps/connect#token=ct_…
```

- It is on the store's own host, so any app can use it and monokulo needs
  no app's domain. The app reads it with its scanner or from a paste; the
  fragment never reaches a server.
- Opened in a browser, the page says to scan it or paste it into the app.
- `token` is single-use and short-lived (10 minutes, like the plugins'
  connect tokens; `Db::consume_connect_token`).

### Redeeming

```http
POST https://pay.yourshop.com/apps/connect
Monokulo-Client: monokular/1.0.0
{ "token": "ct_…", "slug": "monokular", "name": "Monokular",
  "device_name": "Front Counter iPad", "platform": "android" }
→ 200 { "app_key": "ak_…" (secret, shown once), "api": "/api/v1",
        "onion_api": "http://….onion/api/v1" (only while the Monokulo has an onion address) }
```

The app sends it to the link's own address, the code's link without its
`#` part, so a Monokulo served under a path
(`https://example.com/monokulo/apps/connect#token=…`) is reached under it,
and its `api` (`/monokulo/api/v1`) carries the path too.

`slug` and `name` are parsed with the plugins' types, so the same rules hold
(a lowercase letter then 1 to 31 lowercase letters, digits or hyphens, not
one of monokulo's own sources; a name of at most 40 characters with no
invisible formatting). The path is `/apps/connect`, outside
`/connect/{slug}`, so no plugin slug can collide with it. Every error is a
problem (`application/problem+json`): `invalid-connect-code` (401: used,
expired or unknown, ask for a new one), `no-public-address` (503: the code
is still good), `invalid-request`, `unsupported-media-type`, `too-large`,
`rate-limited` (429, wait `retry_after` seconds), `challenge-required` (429:
the app solves the proof of work and sends it again with `Monokulo-Proof`)
and `internal`. The app tells them apart by `type` and shows `detail`.

The answer is the key and the API's entry, nothing else. `api` is a path:
the app resolves it against the address it redeemed the code at, so a till
that connected over an onion address stays on it, and keeps `app_key`
(Keychain / Android Keystore), that absolute entry, the onion entry when
there is one, and whether it goes over Tor (decision 55).
Every later request carries `Authorization: Bearer ak_…` and
`Monokulo-Client: {slug}/{version}`.

The app then reads the entry (`GET /api/v1`) and follows its links:
`mk:store` (`GET /api/v1/store`: name, base currency, and the wallet as
name, network and whole address), `mk:app` (`GET /api/v1/app`: this
device's name as the merchant set it), `mk:events`, `mk:onion-api`, and the
forms `create-order` and `disconnect`. Every link is relative (but the
onion one) and resolved against the URL the app actually called; the app
builds no path. A link or form the key may not use is left out; the app
doesn't try it. The entry is kept per key as its `Cache-Control` says
(`private, max-age=3600`), asked again with `If-None-Match` once it
expires, and read again at once when anything followed from it answers
`401`, `404` or `405` (decision 54).

**The store's details are read live, never saved** (decision 50): after
connecting (the confirm screen, "Connected to …", is drawn from that read),
each time Settings opens, and at app start (the base currency, the store's
name for the till and its notification). They're held in memory for the
run, so a screen shows the last read while the next is under way. The
wallet address is shortened on the device (first 8, "…", last 8); Settings
copies the whole of it.

Errors are `application/problem+json`; the app shows `detail`. A `401` at
the entry means the store disconnected this device (an unknown key is a
`401` on every route, the entry included). Disconnecting (either side)
deletes the connection, its key and its push targets: the app uses
the `disconnect` form (`DELETE /api/v1/app`). Square sign-in is a separate
step in the app (§1) and has nothing to do with monokulo.

**Upgrading.** A till that connected before Monokulo gave `onion_api`
kept only `app_key` and `api`. It carries on as it is, off Tor, and
learns the onion entry from the entry's `mk:onion-api` the next time it
reads the store; Settings then offers Tor. The first app's saved form
(`endpoint`, `public_key`, …), from before the API, was never released
and isn't read: such a till connects again.

### Making an order

The `create-order` form, with the app's key:

```http
POST https://pay.yourshop.com/api/v1/orders
Authorization: Bearer ak_…
Monokulo-Client: monokular/1.0.0
{ "amount": "24.50", "currency": "USD",
  "merchant_order_id": "#1042",         (Square's receipt number, or omitted)
  "idempotency_key": "sq:9f2c…" }       (a retry or a second till gets the same order)
→ 201 Location: /api/v1/orders/order_…
      { "order_id", "status", "is_final", "address", "xmr_amount_piconero",
        "amount", "currency", "merchant_order_id", "expires_at", …,
        "_links": { "self", "mk:order-events", "mk:checkout", … } }
```

- **The app never sends `description`.** It is the API's only free-text
  field, and anyone with the payment link can read it, so it must never
  carry items (§4).
- The order is recorded as made with the app's key, so the dashboard shows
  it as the app's, with the device's name.
- The order carries no payment URI. The app builds the plain one,
  `monero:{address}?tx_amount={XMR}`, and appends the receipt to it (§4).
- The app keeps the order's `self` link, and reads the order there again
  when its event stream reopens. A sale another till made reaches it only
  as a sale event, which links its order (`mk:order`): that one is read
  there.

### What a connected app can do

Make orders, read its store, its orders and its own connection, follow the
store's sale events, disconnect itself, and subscribe to pushes. Never
wallet changes, refunds or spending, and never the store's settings. The list
is shown on both the web connect page and the app's confirm screen.

### Live data while the app is open

```http
GET https://pay.yourshop.com/api/v1/events    (mk:events: SSE, Authorization: Bearer ak_…)
```

The store-wide stream of the same "sale" events as the pushes (§5): `ready`
first, `lagged` when some were missed, and a comment every 25 s. After
`ready` or `lagged` the app reads the orders on screen again, each at its
link. One order's
own stream (`mk:order-events`) is there for a page showing one order; the
app doesn't need it. Used whenever the app is in the foreground, so
on-screen updates never wait for a push. Because every till at a store gets
`sale.waiting` when any of them makes an order, a device without a Square
sign-in (a second iPhone, say) still shows the store's sales, without
receipts.

---

## 3. Wake-ups

The till finds sales by asking Square (§1). What makes it ask is separate,
so the sale source never cares why it was woken.

| Trigger | Where | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Timer** | Every platform | Always, during a shift: every 2 s without the Bell, every 30 s with it (as a backstop for a lost ding) |
| **Ding** from the Monokular Bell | Every platform that registered with one | Within a second or two of Square's webhook |
| **App opened / brought forward** | Every platform | Immediately |

Every trigger does the same thing: fetch since the cursor, idempotently. A
ding carries no sale data, so a lost, late, repeated or forged ding costs at
most one extra request to Square.

A "shift" is the time the app is set to watch for sales (on by default
while the app runs; the cashier can stop it in Settings). Outside a shift
nothing runs.

### Per platform

| Platform | Without the Bell | With the Bell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | Foreground service, 2 s timer during a shift | Ding through UnifiedPush or FCM wakes the service; timer slows to 30 s |
| iPad | Slide Over keeps the app in the foreground: 2 s timer | Ding as an alert push (below); timer slows to 30 s |
| iPhone | Only while the app is open: the cashier switches to it after tendering | Ding as an alert push; the Notification Service Extension fetches the sale and rewrites the alert |

**iPhone and iPad dings are alert pushes, never silent ones.** iOS rations
and delays background (silent) pushes, so they can't be trusted to wake a
till. The Bell sends an alert with `mutable-content`. The Notification Service
Extension, which runs for up to about 30 s with network access, reads the
Square token from a shared Keychain group, fetches the new payment, creates
the order and rewrites the alert as "Monero sale · $24.50 · Tap to show
code". Tapping opens the app, which builds the receipt and shows the code,
and starts or updates the Live Activity (§6). If the extension runs out of
time the alert stays "New sale · Tap to show code" and the app does the rest.

### The Monokular Bell

A small service that turns a POS's webhooks into dings for the right tills.
It lives in this repository (`crates/monokular-bell`, a library and the
`monokular-bell` binary), because it is POS-specific and app-side; monokulo
knows nothing about it. It builds on monokulo's `push`, `live-settings`,
`sqlite`, `rate-limit`, `abuse` and `service-runtime` crates, git
dependencies pinned to one monokulo commit, so it is configured, stores and
limits the way monokulo does. Its API is in [bell.md](bell.md).

```text
Square ──payment.created webhook──▶ Bell: verify signature, read merchant_id
                                         + location_id, drop the body
Bell ──Web Push (empty, encrypted)──▶ each till registered for that location
        (UnifiedPush distributor directly, or APNs/FCM via push-relay, §5)
```

- **Dings go over Web Push**, exactly like monokulo's own pushes (§5): the
  till hands the Bell a Web Push subscription, so the Bell never talks to
  Apple or Google and UnifiedPush needs no relay. The payload is an
  encrypted `{"wake":"square"}`; `Urgency: high`, `TTL: 60`, `Topic: wake`
  so a burst collapses into one.
- **One Square application per Bell.** Square sends webhooks to the
  application a merchant signed in through, so a Bell and the tills that use
  it share one. The project's Bell (`bell.monokulo.com`) uses the project's
  application. A self-hosted Bell is configured with its own application,
  and tills that connect to it sign in to Square through that one (the app
  asks the cashier to sign in again when they switch).
- **What the Bell sees:** Square's webhook bodies, which include each
  payment's amount and card details, for every merchant signed in through
  its application. It reads `merchant_id` and `location_id`, then drops the
  body: none of it is stored or logged. It never sees orders and holds no
  Square token. This is why the Bell is optional and anyone can run their
  own.

Registration, from the app:

```http
POST https://bell.monokulo.com/v1/register
{ "square_access_token": "…",           (used once for GET /v2/locations/{location_id},
                                          whose merchant_id proves both the token and
                                          the location; never stored)
  "location_id": "L…",
  "subscription": { "endpoint", "keys": { "p256dh", "auth" } } }
→ 201 { "registration_id": "br_…", "square_application_id": "…" }
DELETE /v1/register/{registration_id}
GET    /v1/info → { "square_application_id", "environment", "vapid_public_key", "version" }
```

The token check stops anyone from subscribing to dings for a business they
don't control (which would tell them when it takes payments). An endpoint
already registered moves only for its own merchant, or for a caller giving
the subscription's own auth secret: an endpoint is no secret (push services
and distributors see it), so knowing one doesn't take a till's dings away.

Storage: its own SQLite file with `registrations(id, merchant_id,
location_id, endpoint, p256dh, auth, created_at, last_ok_at, failures)`.
Registrations whose endpoint answers 404/410 are deleted, the same rule as
monokulo's push targets, and so are those whose push service fails
`bell.registration_failure_limit` dings in a row. A location takes 32.

Settings (TOML options file plus CLI, invalid values stop the process):
`bell.listen`, `bell.public_uri` (Square's webhook URL is it followed by
`/v1/square/webhook`, and the signature covers it), `bell.store_path`,
`bell.square.application_id`, `bell.square.environment`,
`bell.square.api_url` (a stand-in Square instead of the environment's),
`bell.registration_failure_limit`, `bell.registrations_per_minute`,
`bell.trusted_proxies`, `bell.allow_private_endpoints`, `bell.timeout_ms`.
Secrets from the environment only: `MONOKULAR_BELL_SQUARE_WEBHOOK_KEY` (the
webhook signature key) and `MONOKULAR_BELL_VAPID_KEY` (32 bytes as 64 hex
digits; `/v1/info` gives its public key).

In the app: **Settings › Wake-ups**: "Timer only" (default), "Monokular Bell
(bell.monokulo.com)", or "My own Bell" with a URL. The app reads
`/v1/info` and, if the Square application differs, asks for a new Square
sign-in.

---

## 4. The receipt

The payment code can carry the whole receipt (`orf-codec`, in this
repository: an Open Receipt Format document compacted into one
`orf=<digits>` query parameter). What someone bought must not reach
monokulo, the Bell, the push relay, or anything else between the till and
the customer.

1. **Monokulo never sees the items.** It has no Square access at all, and the
   app never sends an order `description`, the order API's only free-text
   field (§2).
2. **The till fetches the order from Square itself** with its own
   `ORDERS_READ` token. Square POS has no on-device API for other apps, so
   this is a Square API call; the items travel Square ─▶ till ─▶ QR code, and
   Square has them anyway.
3. **`orf-codec` runs in the apps** through UniFFI bindings to the Rust crate
   (Kotlin and Swift), so there is one implementation of the format and its
   dictionary (§9).
4. **The app appends the receipt** to the plain payment URI it built from
   the order's address and amount, with `orf_codec::query::append(uri,
   &receipt)`, which adds `?orf=` or `&orf=` correctly and refuses a URI that
   already has one. The app keeps the plain URI and appends to it fresh each
   time. `orf-codec` knows nothing about Monero.
5. **Without the order, the code still works.** If the order can't be read
   or the receipt doesn't encode, the app shows the plain payment URI.
   Paying never depends on the receipt.

Only the app's own screens show the receipt code. Anything drawn from a push
(the Live Activity's "Show code in island", §6) uses the plain payment URI,
because that content comes through the relay.

---

## 5. Push

Monokulo pushes the state of each order (seen, confirming, paid, expired)
to the store's tills. The Bell's dings (§3) use the same Web Push transport.

### Goals

- A **reusable** piece of monokulo: any connected app can ask for pushes;
  Monokular is only the first user.
- **One transport**: Web Push (RFC 8030), encrypted (RFC 8291, `aes128gcm`)
  and signed (VAPID, RFC 8292), from monokulo and from the Bell.
- UnifiedPush works with no relay at all; APNs and FCM go through a relay
  (`push-relay`), embedded in monokulo or standalone.
- The relay learns as little as possible: no store, no device-to-store link,
  ciphertext for every ordinary notification.

### Why Web Push for everything

A Web Push subscription is `(endpoint URL, p256dh key, auth secret)`. Three
kinds of endpoint all accept the same request:

| Endpoint | Who runs it | Delivers to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UnifiedPush distributor (ntfy, NextPush, …) | The user, or a public instance | Android app via its distributor |
| `https://relay.monokulo.com/v1/push/{handle}` | The project (standalone `monokulo-push-relay`) | APNs (iOS) or FCM (Android with Google services) |
| A browser's push service | Browser vendor | A future web app or admin page |

So a sender only ever does "encrypt, sign, POST to endpoint". Whether that
lands at a UnifiedPush distributor or the relay is the endpoint's business.

### VAPID ties a subscription to one sender

Each monokulo, and each Bell, has one VAPID key pair (P-256), generated on
first start and kept secret. The app reads the public key from
`GET /api/v1/push-targets` (`vapid_public_key`, fetched live each time it
subscribes, so a rotated key is never stale; the connect response is
unchanged) or from the Bell's `/v1/info`. The app passes it to whoever
issues the endpoint:

- UnifiedPush: the app gives it to the distributor at registration (the
  AND_3 spec's VAPID field), which then refuses pushes not signed by it.
- The relay: the app registers its APNs/FCM token **with the VAPID key**, and
  the relay accepts pushes to that handle only when the VAPID JWT verifies
  against it.

This needs no per-sender relay account: a sender is identified by its VAPID
key, rate limits are per key, and a stolen endpoint URL is useless without
the sender's private key. A till holds one subscription per sender (its
store's monokulo, and the Bell if it uses one).

### Two kinds of subscription

| Kind | Payload | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `encrypted` | RFC 8291 ciphertext | Every notification and ding, and every Android message |
| `live-activity` | Plain JSON (iOS applies Live Activity pushes itself, with no extension to decrypt) | Live Activity updates only: `phase`, `sale`, `amount`, `currency`, `xmr`, `expiresAt`, `waitingCount`, and `paymentURI` only when the device turned on "Show code in island" (§6) and only while the sale takes a payment. Never the order's id. |

For `encrypted`, the iOS Notification Service Extension and the Android
receiver decrypt with the subscription's private key, which never leaves the
device.

### Two crates: `push` and `push-relay`

Push is split like the engine: a library every sender uses, and a relay that
runs embedded in monokulo or on its own, the way the engine runs inside
monokulo by default and as `monokulo-engine` when separate.

| Crate | Kind | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `push` | library | Every monokulo and the Bell (sending), `push-relay` (VAPID checks), tests |
| `push-relay` | library + binary `monokulo-push-relay` | Monokulo (embedded, cargo feature `relay`, on by default), or standalone |

Keeping them apart means a monokulo built with `--no-default-features`
drops the relay's server code, APNs/FCM clients and OAuth entirely, and
another Rust sender (the Bell) only takes the small crate. The Bell depends
on `push` from the monokulo repository (a git dependency pinned to one
monokulo commit until `push` is published to crates.io).

### The `push` crate (`crates/push`)

A library with no monokulo types and no server code.

```text

generation already in monokulo's lock), tested against RFC 8291 Appendix A
and RFC 8292's example token; no `web-push-native` or `jwt-simple`
(monokulo `docs/decisions/push.md` 3 and 4). Builds on stable.

### The `push-relay` crate (`crates/push-relay`)

```text
crates/push-relay/src/
  lib.rs            Relay::start(&RelayConfig), Relay::router() -> axum::Router,
                    Relay::serve(listener, shutdown); the hourly sweep of expired handles
  settings.rs       the settings, declared once (live-settings): RelayConfig, load(), Host
  cli.rs            `monokulo-push-relay`'s command line, from the declarations
  routes.rs         POST /v1/register, POST /v1/push/{handle}  (no unregister: nothing
                    would call it; handles expire and die when APNs/FCM say the token is gone)
  handles.rs        Handle, HandleId (ph_…), Platform, DeviceToken; HandleStore on sqlite
                    (its own file, migrations/0001_handles.sql); no trait, no in-memory store
  apns.rs           APNs: HTTP/2 (prior knowledge), ES256 provider token renewed at 50 min;
                    alert, liveactivity (always an update), push-to-start
  fcm.rs            FCM HTTP v1: RS256 service-account assertion (rsa) exchanged for an
                    access token, kept until 5 min before it expires; data messages
  limits.rs         per sender, per handle and per address, on the workspace's rate-limit crate
  upstream.rs       what APNs's and FCM's answers mean for the sender (gone, too large,
                    unavailable with Retry-After, refused)
  problem.rs        the problem+json answers
  main.rs           `monokulo-push-relay`: --options, --init, serve until SIGTERM
```

The library interface is small on purpose: settings in, a `Relay` out,
served on a listener. Monokulo (`crates/monokulo/src/relay.rs`) and the
standalone binary build it the same way and differ only in who owns the
listener and where the settings come from (`[relay.*]` of monokulo's
options file, or `relay.toml`).

### Crates

Chosen to fit the workspace: rustls only (there's no OpenSSL in `Cargo.lock`),
RustCrypto, reqwest, axum, tokio.

| Need | Crate | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RFC 8291, VAPID | `p256` 0.14 (`ecdh`, `ecdsa`), `hkdf`, `aes-gcm`, `sha2`, written in `push` | The RustCrypto generation already in the lock; `web-push-native` 0.5 pins the one before it and would duplicate the crates for about 150 lines of well-specified code, tested here against the RFCs' own vectors (`push.md` 3). |
| JWT (VAPID ES256, APNs ES256) | `push::jwt::Es256Key` on `p256` | One signature over two base64url segments; `jwt-simple` would bring `k256`, `p384`, `ed25519-compact` and more (`push.md` 4). |
| FCM OAuth (RS256) | `rsa` 0.9 (already in the tree) | A thin client: one service-account assertion exchanged at `token_uri`. `gcp_auth` adds `ring` and discovers credentials by itself, against the settings rule (`push.md` 5). |
| HTTP | `reqwest` (already used), `http2` feature | APNs requires HTTP/2. The feature reaches every reqwest client in a monokulo built with the relay (`push.md` 118). |
| Server | `axum`, `tokio` (already used) | Relay and Bell routes. |
| Rate limits | the workspace's `rate-limit` crate | Fixed windows with `Retry-After`, already serving the engine and monokulo; keyed by VAPID key, handle and address (`push.md` 6). |
| Storage | `rusqlite` through the workspace's `sqlite` crate | Monokulo's tables, the relay's handles, the Bell's registrations. |

For APNs, `a2` was considered and not used: it hasn't been released since
2024 and has no Live Activity push type. APNs is a single HTTP/2 POST
(`/3/device/{token}`, headers `apns-push-type`, `apns-topic`,
`apns-priority`, `apns-expiration`, `apns-collapse-id`, bearer JWT refreshed
every 50 minutes), so a thin client on reqwest is smaller and easier to keep
current.

### The relay API

Registration, from the app:

```http
POST /v1/register
{ "platform": "apns" | "apns-liveactivity" | "apns-pushtostart" | "fcm",
  "token": "<APNs/FCM device or activity token>",
  "app": "monokular",                   // picks the bundle ID / FCM project
  "vapid_public_key": "BJ…" }           // the sender: a monokulo or a Bell
→ 201 { "endpoint": "https://relay.monokulo.com/v1/push/ph_7f3k…",
        "expires_at": … }
```

- One registration per (platform, token, app, VAPID key): a device connected
  to two stores gets two handles, which the relay can't link to each other.
  Registering the same four again gives the same endpoint, its expiry
  pushed back; a handle lasts `handles.ttl_days` (90) after its last
  registration or delivered push.
- There is no unregister route: it would be unauthenticated (the app holds
  no secret the relay knows) or sender-only, and nothing would call it.
  Handles expire, and die as soon as APNs or FCM says the token is gone.
- Tokens change; the app re-registers whenever iOS or Android hands it a new
  one and sends the new endpoint to monokulo and the Bell.

Delivery, from a sender (plain Web Push):

```http
POST /v1/push/ph_7f3k…
Authorization: vapid t=<JWT>, k=<public key>
Content-Encoding: aes128gcm          (encrypted kind)  |  application/json (live-activity kind)
TTL: 1800
Urgency: high | normal | low
Topic: 3f9c0a7e…                     (32 hex digits: a hash of the order id, which
                                      collapses superseded updates and tells the
                                      relay nothing)
```

The relay checks the JWT against the handle's key, applies limits, and
translates:

| Handle platform | APNs/FCM request |
| --- | --- |
| `apns` | `apns-push-type: alert`, `mutable-content: 1`, the ciphertext in a custom key; the Notification Service Extension decrypts and fills in title and body (for a ding, it fetches the sale first, §3). Fallback text: "New sale". |
| `apns-liveactivity` | `apns-push-type: liveactivity`, topic `<bundle>.push-type.liveactivity`, `aps.content-state` from the plain JSON, always `event: update` (the relay never ends an activity, which the app idles or ends itself), `alert` only for paid ("Paid · 24.50 USD") / expired ("No payment yet"), `stale-date` from `expiresAt` while the sale is open. |
| `apns-pushtostart` | `event: start` (iOS 17.2+), only if the app opted in: the JSON is `{"attributes-type", "attributes", "content-state"}`, handed on as it is. |
| `fcm` | Data message, priority from `Urgency`, the ciphertext as data; the app decrypts. |

Answers back to the sender, as problem+json: `201`; `404 unknown-handle`
when APNs/FCM say the token is dead (the relay deletes the handle; the
sender deletes the target) or the handle expired; `401` when the VAPID
signature isn't the handle's sender's; `413`; `429` and `503` with
`Retry-After`; `502` when APNs or FCM refuse the relay's own setup. The
full list is the docs page `/push-relay/` (monokulo `xtask/src/pages/docs/push-relay.md`).

### Running the relay

**Embedded** (in every release build of monokulo, off unless turned on):

```toml
[relay]
enabled = true                 # default false: only useful with APNs/FCM keys

[relay.server]
listen = "0.0.0.0:8444"        # its own listener (8443 is the engine's), so its limits
                               # and logs stay apart from the store pages
public_uri = "https://relay.example.org"

[relay.handles.apps.monokular]
apns_topic = "com.example.monokular"
fcm_project_id = "monokular-12345"

[relay.apns]
team_id = "ABCDE12345"
key_id = "FGHIJ67890"
```

**Standalone:**

```sh
monokulo-push-relay --options relay.toml
```

Both read the same settings, declared once in `push-relay` and registered
by both binaries (the same pattern as the engine's `[engine.*]` /
`--engine-…` settings in monokulo). Every key has two parts, so it can sit
under monokulo's `[relay.*]` tables: `server.listen`, `server.public_uri`,
`server.trusted_proxies`, `server.upstream_timeout_ms`, `store.path`,
`handles.ttl_days`, `handles.apps` (bundle ID and FCM project per app),
`limits.per_sender_per_minute`, `limits.per_handle_per_minute`,
`limits.registrations_per_minute`, `apns.endpoint`, `apns.team_id`,
`apns.key_id`, `fcm.endpoint`, and for the standalone binary alone
`logging.level` and `logging.format`. `relay.enabled` is monokulo's own,
shown read-only on its admin page; the `[relay.*]` settings are read from
the options file and `--relay-…` at start and are not edited on the admin
page (a follow-up, `push.md` 16). They are checked at every start, the
relay on or off, so a mistake stops monokulo then. Invalid values stop the
process, as everywhere else in monokulo. Secrets come only from the
environment, in both cases:

```text
MONOKULO_RELAY_APNS_KEY         (.p8 contents)
MONOKULO_RELAY_FCM_CREDENTIALS  (service-account JSON)
```

**Storage:** the relay always keeps its own SQLite file (`store.path`, by
default `push-relay.db` beside monokulo's database when embedded), never
tables in monokulo's database. It never touches store data, and moving
from embedded to standalone is a matter of copying that file. It holds only
`handles(id, platform, app, token, vapid_public_key, created_at,
last_used_at, expires_at)`. No payloads are stored and no request bodies,
tokens or endpoints are logged (a test reads the whole log to check).

**Who runs what:** the project runs the official relay **standalone**, next
to the official Bell, so both can be deployed and scaled on their own
schedule. Embedding suits a small operator shipping their own app with their
own APNs/FCM keys: one process, one upgrade. Either way their app registers
with that relay and hands the endpoint to its senders, with no change to
monokulo.

**Release artifacts:** `monokulo` (relay included), `monokulo-engine` and
`monokulo-push-relay` from the monokulo workspace; `monokular-bell` from
this one.

### UnifiedPush

On Android the app uses the UnifiedPush connector. With a distributor
installed (ntfy, NextPush, …) the endpoint is the distributor's and pushes
go **straight from the sender to the distributor**, with no relay. Without
one, the app falls back to FCM through the relay (or the UnifiedPush
embedded FCM distributor pointed at the relay; check that library's gateway
contract before choosing). On a phone without Google services and without a
distributor, Monokular keeps its foreground service on the store's SSE
stream and the Square timer during a shift (§7).

### Push targets in monokulo (`push_targets`)

```text
vapid_keys(id, public_key, private_key_encrypted, created_at_utc)
push_targets(id pt_…, store_id, app_id, client_id, kind encrypted|live-activity,
             endpoint, p256dh, auth, events, include_payment_uri,
             created_at_utc, last_ok_at_utc, failures)
```

- Registered by the app with its key (`ak_` only): `POST` the
  `register-push-target` form on `GET /api/v1/push-targets` (which carries
  `vapid_public_key`), found from the entry's `mk:push-targets` like
  everything else; `GET` and `DELETE /api/v1/push-targets/{id}`. The app
  picks a `client_id` per subscription; registering it again replaces the
  subscription on the same target (the design's `PUT`, as `api-macros`
  has `get`/`post`/`delete` and every link names a `GET`-able resource).
  At most 8 targets per app.
- `kind` and keys can't mix: `encrypted` needs `p256dh` and `auth`,
  `live-activity` takes none and may set `include_payment_uri` (the "Show
  code in island" switch, decided at registration). A `CHECK` in the table
  says the same.
- Removed when the connection is disconnected (cascade), when the endpoint
  answers 404/410, or after 20 counted failures in a row
  (`push.target_failure_limit`; `429` doesn't count).
- `events` is a list of the seven `sale.*` names, every one by default; no
  glob syntax.

### Events

Every event is about an order a connected app made (§2); the payload has
the order id, its `merchant_order_id`, the amount, the address,
`xmr_amount_piconero` and `expires_at`. No event carries items.

| Event | From | Urgency | Notification | Live Activity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sale.waiting` | An app made an order | normal | none (the till that made it already shows it; the other apps' targets get it) | phase waiting |
| `sale.seen` | `order.unconfirmed` | low | none | phase seen |
| `sale.confirming` | `order.confirming` | low | none | phase confirming |
| `sale.paid` | `order.paid` / `order.overpaid` | high | "Paid · $24.50" | phase paid, alert; the app idles the activity |
| `sale.partial` | `order.partial` | high | "Part paid" | phase waiting (the engine's event doesn't carry what arrived, so no "amount left") |
| `sale.expired` | `order.expired` | high | "No payment yet" | phase expired, alert |
| `sale.double_spend` | `order.double_spend_detected` | high | "Payment reversed" | phase expired |

Payloads use the same body versioning as webhooks (`api_version`) so a
connected app can rely on them. `TTL` is the time left on the code (at
least a minute, at most `push.default_ttl_secs`, 30 minutes) for the
events before a sale is settled, and 30 minutes for `paid`, `expired` and
`double_spend`; `Topic` is the first 32 hex digits of the order id's
SHA-256, the same for every push about one order.

### Delivery path

Pushes ride the existing webhooks pipeline rather than a parallel one:

```text
engine order_events ──SSE──▶ webhooks::subscriber
                               │ same transaction
                               ├─▶ webhook_deliveries   (unchanged)
                               └─▶ push_deliveries      (new: one row per target)
push::delivery worker ──Web Push──▶ endpoint (distributor or relay)
```

`push_deliveries` reuses the webhook worker's shape (claim, send, back off,
give up), with two differences: a newer delivery with the same `Topic`
supersedes an unsent older one, and deliveries past their TTL are dropped,
not retried (a "Seen" update an hour late is worse than none). The row
keeps the plaintext payload and each attempt encrypts it afresh (RFC 8291
wants a fresh salt and key per message). Retries wait 5, 20, 80 and 320 s
or what `Retry-After` says, never past the TTL, five attempts at most.
Nothing runs until an app registers a target: there is no `push.enabled`.

---

## 6. The Live Activity

A status display for the current sale on iPhone. It creates nothing and
fetches nothing (Live Activity code has no network); the app starts or
updates it when it finds a sale (§3), monokulo's pushes move it through the
later phases, and iOS redraws it.

**Static attributes** (set by the app when it starts the activity, so never
through the relay): location label, store name.

**Content state**:

| Field | Example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phase` | idle / waiting / seen / confirming / paid / expired | Layout and colour |
| `sale` | "#1042" | Label |
| `amount` | "24.50" | Large amount, formatted by the device with `currency` |
| `currency` | "USD" | With `amount`: no server formats money for the device's locale |
| `xmr` | "0.1421" | Second line |
| `expiresAt` | 1761312000 | Unix seconds: a countdown iOS draws itself (`Text(timerInterval:)`), and `stale-date` |
| `waitingCount` | 2 | The store's app orders still waiting for a payment, this one included while it is: "+1 more" at 2 |
| `paymentURI` | `monero:…` | **Only** when the device has "Show code in island" on; the plain URI, never the receipt (§4) |

**Show code in island** is a per-device setting, off by default. Turning it
on explains that the payment address of each sale then passes through the
Monokular push relay, and that the island's code has no receipt. Off: the
expanded island shows amount, status and "Tap to show code"; the QR appears
only in the app.

| Phase | Compact | Expanded / lock screen | Set by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| idle | Logo + green dot | "Watching for sales · Front Counter" | the app |
| waiting | Logo + "$24.50" | Amount, XMR, countdown, QR if enabled | the app, on finding a sale |
| seen | Logo + "Seen" | "Seen on the network" | push, silent, low |
| confirming | Logo + "1/2" | "Confirming" | push, silent, low |
| paid | Tick + "$24.50" | "Paid · 0.1421 XMR received" | push, alert, high; the app idles the activity |
| expired | Clock | "No payment yet · refund in Square" | push, alert, high |

Lifecycle: one activity per shift, started by the app (iOS ends it after 8 h;
the next app launch starts a new one; push-to-start is opt-in because it
sends the attributes through the relay). Monokulo's pushes never end it:
the relay sends every state as an `update` (`paid` and `expired` with an
alert), and the app takes the activity back to idle or ends it itself
(monokulo `push.md` 113). Overlapping sales show the newest plus "+N more".
Tapping opens `monokular://sale/{id}`.

The waiting phase needs the app to run, so on iPhone it appears when the
cashier opens the app or taps the Bell's alert (§3), not on its own.

---

## 7. Battery and latency

| State | Finding sales | Order updates | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App in the foreground | 2 s timer (30 s with the Bell) | SSE to the store's monokulo | Normal app use |
| iPad in Slide Over | Same | Same | Normal app use; tills are usually on chargers |
| iPhone in the background | Bell alert + Notification Service Extension; nothing without the Bell | APNs via the relay | Close to nothing |
| Android with a UnifiedPush distributor | Foreground service: Bell ding or 2 s timer | Direct Web Push to the distributor | The distributor's one connection, plus the timer during a shift |
| Android with Google services | Same, dings via FCM | FCM via the relay | Close to nothing beyond the timer |
| Android with neither | Foreground service on the 2 s timer | SSE in the same service, heartbeat 25 s | Small; only during a shift |

Rules:

- Timers run only during a shift and slow to 30 s whenever a Bell is set up.
- Push on state change only; at most five pushes per sale.
- `high` urgency only for dings, paid, partial, expired and double spend;
  everything else `low` or `normal`. APNs and FCM throttle apps that overuse
  high priority.
- `Topic` collapses superseded updates; `TTL` equals the time left on the
  code (60 s for dings).
- iOS: `NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates` for busy tills.
- Square requests: one `ListPayments` per tick per till, plus one order read
  per Monero sale. The spike measures Square's limits for a busy store with
  several tills on one application.

                                the feature, relay.enabled and [relay.*] stop monokulo
```

There is no Square code in monokulo.

### Migrations

New tables only (numbered after 0042); nothing existing changes shape, and
no data moves: the store's shop plugin stays where it is.

- `app_connections` (store, slug, name, device name, platform, key hash,
  last seen), `app_connect_tokens`
- `0052_push_targets.sql`: `vapid_keys` (encrypted private key) and `push_targets`
- `0053_push_deliveries.sql`: `push_deliveries`, and a nullable
  `app_orders.last_sale_event` for the Live Activity's `waitingCount`
- none for the relay: its handles live in its own SQLite file (§5)

### Settings (registry)

- `push.delivery_timeout_ms`, `push.max_attempts`, `push.default_ttl_secs`,
  `push.keep_days`, `push.target_failure_limit` (a "Pushes to apps" card on
  the admin Payments tab); no `push.enabled`: nothing runs until an app
  registers a target
- `relay.enabled` (monokulo's own) and `[relay.*]` (declared in push-relay,
  read by monokulo at start when built with the relay, §5)

### Tests

In-process like the rest of monokulo wherever a push needn't land
(queueing, superseding, TTL, give-up, target deletion); where it must, a
stub UnifiedPush endpoint on `127.0.0.1:0` takes it and
`push::encrypt::decrypt` checks what arrived, in tests named `over_http`.
There are no provider traits or in-memory stores for tests: the relay's
APNs and FCM endpoints are settings, so its tests point them at stand-ins
on loopback (HTTP/2 with prior knowledge for APNs). Monokulo's
`push::pipeline_tests::relay_tests` run the whole chain once: a relay
served in-process, a sale pushed to its handles, and what the stand-in
APNs and FCM received read as the device would. App keys on
`/api/v1/orders` are tested for idempotency across two apps, the app
recorded as the source, and a disconnected app's key refused.

## 9. The Monokular repository

A separate public repository, `monokular`, holding both apps, the Bell, the
receipt codec and their shared contract. The apps are native (SwiftUI,
Jetpack Compose); what they share is the contract, test vectors and
`orf-codec`.

GitHub description:

> Monokular: iPhone, iPad and Android companion for Monokulo. Take Monero next to your till: it sees Monero sales in your POS (Square first) and shows the customer the payment code, in the Dynamic Island, Slide Over or a floating bubble.

Choices:

- **Native per platform** over a shared UI toolkit: Live Activities, Slide
  Over, overlays and Live Updates are each platform's own APIs.
- **The pure core is a package/module with no UI framework.** The parts most
  likely to be wrong (decryption, event decoding, Square reconciliation, link
  parsing) build and test on Linux, so most work doesn't wait on a macOS
  runner.
- **monokulo is the source of truth for its contract:** its xtask writes
  `protocol/vectors/` from the real Rust code, and both apps' tests read
  them. Changing an event shape breaks the app tests, not a till.
- **The receipt codec is shared Rust, through UniFFI.** A bit-exact format
  with a trained zstd dictionary shouldn't be written twice. The rest of the
  core stays native: a shared Rust core for it isn't worth the build
  complexity for this amount of logic.

## 10. Delivery plan

1. **Square spike** on a real account with $0 Other tenders: Other tenders in
   `ListPayments` and in `payment.created`; `RefundPayment` on them;
   `device_details` for routing; PKCE sign-in from a phone with an App Link
   redirect, and its refresh token rules; request limits with several tills
   polling every 2 s on one application. Record the responses into
   `protocol/square/`.
2. **Connected apps** in monokulo: tables, the Connected apps card, the
   connect page and code, `/apps/connect`, and app keys on the HTTP API
   (`/api/v1`: orders, the store's events, the app's own connection).
3. **Monokular Android, timer only:** connect, Square sign-in, the payments
   cursor, making orders, the receipt (`orf-codec-ffi` Kotlin bindings,
   `query::append`, the plain-code fallback), SSE, the foreground service.
   **iPad** follows the same way (Slide Over, timer only).
4. **`crates/push`** and push targets in monokulo; UnifiedPush end to end
   with ntfy for order updates.
5. **The Monokular Bell:** Square webhooks, registration with the token
   check, dings over Web Push; UnifiedPush dings on Android.
6. **`push-relay`**: APNs (alert, liveactivity) and FCM, the standalone
   binary and the embedded mount; the official relay and Bell deployed.
7. **iPhone:** the Notification Service Extension handling dings, then the
   Live Activity. Android's overlay bubble and Live Updates alongside.

Android and iPad come first because they work with a timer alone: no relay,
no Bell, no Mac for Android.

Status, 2026-10-27: the server side of 4, 5 and 6 is built (monokulo's
`push` crate, push targets and deliveries, `push-relay` standalone and
embedded; the Bell), reviewed and tested; see [reports/bell.md](reports/bell.md)
and monokulo's `docs/reports/bell-and-relay.md`. The app wiring (UnifiedPush
and relay registration, Settings › Wake-ups), the deployments of the official
relay and Bell, and the Square spike (1) are open.

## 11. Open questions

- Square: Other tenders in the Payments API and webhooks; refunds of them;
  whether `device_details` is enough to route a sale to one till; request
  limits per application with many tills polling.
- Square PKCE: confirm the refresh token lifetime and single-use rule, that a
  mobile redirect to an App Link / universal link is accepted, and that a
  shared Keychain group lets the Notification Service Extension use and
  refresh the token safely alongside the app.
- Square POS for Android: does it hide other apps' overlays on its checkout
  screens (`HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS`)? If so the bubble disappears there.
- UnifiedPush embedded FCM distributor: can it point at our relay, or does
  Android talk to the relay's FCM path directly?
- The island's code (when on) carries no receipt. Is that clear enough to
  cashiers, or should the island say "Open for receipt code"?
- iPadOS 26.1: the exact steps to put an app in Slide Over, for onboarding
  copy.
- The Bell's and the relay's hosts: `bell.monokulo.com` and
  `relay.monokulo.com` are placeholders. The Square sign-in redirect and the
  App Links are on `monokular.monokulo.com` (this repo's GitHub Pages);
  connect codes are on each store's own host.
- Publishing `push` to crates.io so the Bell needn't use a git dependency.
  Until then the Bell pins one monokulo commit; after the push PRs merge
  the pin moves to `main`'s commit.
- `crypto-bigint` 0.7.5 (under `p256`) is yanked (RUSTSEC-2026-0387); both
  repositories move to 0.7.10 or later together on 2026-11-09, when it is
  two weeks old, or sooner if the owner says the fix wins over the rule.
- App Store review of a crypto-payments companion; Google Play's "display
  over other apps" declaration and its foreground service type for a shift.
