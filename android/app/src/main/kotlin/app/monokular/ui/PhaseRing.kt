 * The design's phase ring (its Chips and status rows): an open ring whose
 * arc is a still [fill] quarter while the sale waits, then, once the payment
 * is seen, the [paid] green turning a lap every `motion.spin` and growing
 * with each of its [confirmations] towards [required] ([ringFill]), until
 * paid closes it and it stops. Decoration: the words beside it say the phase.
 *
 * A change of length sweeps (`docs/motion.md` M6, `motion.sweep`): the arc
 * grows from where it is, so a second step mid-sweep just carries on. The
 * arc's two colours are two strokes, never a blend of them (decision 190):
 * the one going fades out under `motion.fadeQuick` before the one coming
 * fades in (`motion.fadeThrough`), so on the way to seen, or from a paid
 * ring to the next sale's, the ring is only ever [fill], [paid], or one of
 * them fading over the [track]. Paid, the turn stops where the arc is and the
 * arc closes from there, so it never jumps back to the top; under reduced
 * motion it never turns, and only its length steps.
 * The first composition draws the phase's own fill, so a ring that appears
 * at Seen doesn't sweep in. Every animated value, the turn too, is read only
 * in the draw lambda: a step or a turn redraws the ring and recomposes
 * nothing, and nothing is allocated per frame.
