 * The folded tray's stack (the fixes canvas's board 4): the hidden sales peek as two card edges under the third row,
 * like a notification stack, over a "+N" pill. Pulled down, the edges follow the finger, each taking half the pull,
 * widening toward the card and growing toward a row's height; let go past a third of [REACH_DP], or flung down, the
 * tray opens, else the stack settles back. All in dp, so it is the same on any screen; [pull] is how far the stack
 * is pulled past its rest (negative while it grows back in as the tray folds).
