/**

 * for the panel growing out of the bubble and the bubble appearing
 * (`docs/motion.md` M1, M4). One [Animatable] per window, read only in
 * `graphicsLayer {}` and `offset {}`, animated in the window's own
 * composition (its frame clock) with `motion.surface`: [enter] and [exit]
 * retarget from the current value and velocity, so a tap mid-grow reverses
 * it, and an exit's landing is reported once and only if nothing
 * interrupted it. The overlay calls in before the window has composed, so
 * the latest call waits for [Attach].
