 * bubble: its window goes up first with the docked bubble where the free
 * one is, and the free one goes once the panel has drawn; lowered, the
 * panel collapses back into the docked bubble, which slides back to where
 * the free one will be, the free one comes back there at rest, and the
 * panel goes once it has drawn. On a tablet the bubble stays and the panel
 * comes and goes beside it. A panel of the other kind (a fold opened, split
 * screen) is swapped without motion. Pure, so the order is tested on the JVM.
